## What is Trashmac

Trashmac is a documentation of my personal projects. I am a Mac nthusiast, having lots of peojects at the same time. Mostly modifing existant Macbooks with custom hardware and software, and Building Hackintosh using OpenCore (and little bit of Clover)

## Introduction of my Home Lab

Even though my intrests are mostly Apple computers, I do a bunch of coding on Linux as well. I used to be an Ubuntu user as a daily. Today is just bunch of different computer which was already home so I formed them to fulfill all needs in my Home Laboratory.

before we get into the Mac stuff, I want to tell you about my Debian instanse, which is running on a Rock64 SBC next to my Mikrotik Router.

## The DietPi
