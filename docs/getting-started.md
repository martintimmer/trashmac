## What is Trashmac

Trashmac is a documentation of my personal projects. I am a Mac nthusiast, having lots of peojects at the same time. Mostly modifing existant Macbooks with custom hardware and software, and Building Hackintosh using OpenCore (and little bit of Clover)

## Introduction of my Home Lab

Even though Jamdocs is so simple, you dont really need to set it up localy (you could just fork it on github to edit styles and md-files) - if you want to change it up a bit I recommend setting up localy for a better developer experience.

To set up a new instance of Jamdocs, and start developing just clone the project from Github like, go to the directory and run gridsome:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelhorn/jamdocs project-name
cd project-name
gridsome develop
```
